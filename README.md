# Bless-Bot
Bless Bot is a light-hearted Discord bot for 'blessing' the chat and its users, while also sharing funny gifs.

'index.js' is the main file designed to start Bless Bot up, monitor the chat, and summon dymanic commands.

Files for commands include:
1. **bless.js** (command: 'bless', arguments: NA, 'chat', 'me')
